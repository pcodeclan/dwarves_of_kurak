#### Intro To The World Of Kurak
We live in times of peace, child. But â€˜twas not always so. For lifetimes ago an age of strife gripped the world.

The machinations of fate drove three Dwarves to take up arms and rise against this evil.

As unyielding as the mountains that have guarded our ancestral homes for eons, 
their story has been passed down the generations, written in the sacred tome that would one day be called...
